                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p> The overall purpose for the WaterSIMmersive project is to help 
                        community members from diverse areas and backgrounds, many of whom 
                        have been historically under-represented in key discussions, better 
                        understand their water systems; this includes understanding where 
                        their water comes from, how it is used, who relies on its supply, 
                        and how adjudication efforts can play a role in establishing water 
                        security. We are hoping that the exhibits we develop with communities 
                        across the state will inform STEM learning about natural resource management 
                        and equip multi-generational community members with the knowledge they need 
                        to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of their communities for generations
